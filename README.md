**[Play Online](https://alejandrade.github.io/WebFlappyBird/)** | **[☕ Support the Project](https://ko-fi.com/alejandrade)**

##  How to Play

Navigate your bird through an endless series of pipes by tapping or clicking to flap. Each successful pass through a pipe earns you a point. The game gets progressively harder as you score more points!

### Controls
* **Desktop:** Press `SPACE` or `LEFT CLICK` to flap
* **Mobile:** Tap the screen to flap
* **Esc:** Quit the game (desktop only)

### Tips
* Timing is everything - don't spam the flap button!
* The bird gains momentum as it falls, so plan your flaps accordingly
* Try to stay in the middle of the screen when possible
* Your high score is saved automatically
